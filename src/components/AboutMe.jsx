            <p>
                Hi, my name is Fernando Brum and Iâ€™m a developer since 2015. Started my career being a PHP backend developer,
                but life lead me to create a crave to knowledge and keep learning about all that I can.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since then learned about JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3,  jQuery, Python, NodeJS, React and React Native. I also have
                interesting about another topics, like UX, UI, astronomy, physics, politics, cooking... and of course movies,
                series, HQs and games like a good nerd.
            </p>
